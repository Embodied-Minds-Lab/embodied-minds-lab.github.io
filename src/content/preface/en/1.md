Welcome to the **Embodied Minds Lab** at Harvard! We're a interdisciplinary set of researchers workly broadly on the research question of constructing intelligent agents in the physical world. Our lab focuses on both the fundamental development of new machine learning algorithms as well as their applications in real-world agents. A current research focus for the lab is the construction of robust generative models of the world and the use of such models for downstream tasks such as planning, perception, and reasoning. Our lab is also interested in the use of these generative tools in domains such as scientific discovery and engineering design. Our lab is in the [Kempner Institute](https://kempnerinstitute.harvard.edu/) and computer science in the [Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/).
