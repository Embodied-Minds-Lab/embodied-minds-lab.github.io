Welcome to the Harvard Embodied Intelligence Lab! We're a interdisciplinary set of researchers workly broadly on the research question of constructing intelligent agents in the physical world. Our lab focuses on both the fundamental development of new machine learning algorithms as well as their applications in embodied agents. A current research focus for the lab is the construction of robust generative models of world and the use of such models for dwonstream tasks such as planning, perception, and reasoning. Our lab is also interested in the use of these generative tools in domains such a scientific discovery and engineering design. Our lab is in the Kempner Institute and computer science in the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
